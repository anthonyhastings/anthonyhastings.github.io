## Introduction
This site acts as a simple portfolio style one pager to showcase off some of
my work and list a few ways to contact me and see my code contributions.

## Installation
The entire tooling stack is `npm` based. Have a look in the `package.json` for
a list of available commands.

## Functionality
- "Add to Homescreen" functionality (via Web Manifest).
- Offline functionality (via ServiceWorker).
- Mobile browser theme colours (via Web Manifest & Metadata).
- Solid build tooling and editor configuration (via NPM Packages and Scripts).
- Semantic, clean and accessible markup.
- Modern styling build pattern (using BEM as a methodology).
- SVG spriting (via SVG defs).
